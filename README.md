This project focuses on  customer segmentation analysis of e-commerce transaction data to identify distinct customer groups. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior within an e-commerce platform. The data includes columns such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, City, Membership Type, Total Spend, Items Purchased, Average Rating, Discount Applied, Days Since Last Purchase, and Satisfaction Level. This detailed information facilitates nuanced analysis of customer preferences, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels, aiding businesses in making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience.

Objectives
To define customer segments based on purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms.
To develop visualizations that illustrate customer segments and spending patterns.

First we look at gender distribution. The distribution of gender is nearly equal, with 175 males and 173 females. It suggests balanced representation for gender-based analysis.
Next, we take a look on average spending by gender We see male customers spend significantly more on average than female customers with approximately 987 units while women customers with approximately 707 units.
This suggests that male customers are more profitable for the e-commerce platform.
